                        <h3>TUTORING THE TUTOR</h3>
                        <p>
                            Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an incident
                            with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift, library staff are
                            the default computer technicians/troubleshooters. One night, this part-time
                            lecturer came to the counter, stating that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc
                            stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit foolish, because she was
                            instructing a class in basic computing and was unable to solve the problem in
                            front of a room full of students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject button, out
                            popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
                            'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing to an old 5.25in
                            floppy disc slot, which was there even though the drives themselves had long
                            since been decommissioned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine
                            and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD back,
                            she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her class,
                            shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching people to handle
                            their computers with care!"

                        <h3>TUTORING THE TUTOR</h3>
                        <p>
                            Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an incident
                            with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift, library staff are
                            the default computer technicians/troubleshooters. One night, this part-time
                            lecturer came to the counter, stating that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc
                            stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit foolish, because she was
                            instructing a class in basic computing and was unable to solve the problem in
                            front of a room full of students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject button, out
                            popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
                            'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing to an old 5.25in
                            floppy disc slot, which was there even though the drives themselves had long
                            since been decommissioned.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine
                            and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD back,
                            she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her class,
                            shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching people to handle
                            their computers with care!"

                            David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever pair of IT Diploma
                            students who handed in a joint research assignment, complete with the required signed
                            statement that it was all their original work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly impressed to find
                            three pages of the document written in perfect technical German, particularly given
                            that the students in question were none too articulate when I asked
                            <i>'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care taken when cutting
                            and pasting to cover assignment work.

                            Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer knows the subject.

                        proves that tech support is one of the most stressful jobs on earth. He recalls
                        working for a small internet provider in the late '90s, when one of the customers
                        was a local police officer.

                        "He was also an expert in crashing Windows 98. On one occasion, he brought his
                        tower into the office, sat it on the counter, pulled his service pistol out of
                        his holster and pointed it straight at the tower, threatening to shoot it.

                    <p>
                        Another time he put his (by now very nervous) PC tower onto the counter, again
                        took out his pistol, held it by the barrel and started banging the butt of the
                        gun onto the top of the computer, quite hard too.
